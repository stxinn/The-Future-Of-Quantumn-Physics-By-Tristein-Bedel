                  <br> In this essay, I am documenting all that I have learned about Quantum Mechanics and Quantum physics. I hope one day that an idea will pop into one of our minds and change the future. I tried to see all major aspects of Quantum mechanics to better understand it, And I hope by the end of this I can give insight to others and myself to the subject that confused the most brilliant scientists and what will make the technology of the future tick.

                  <hr class="rounded">
                  Quantum mechanics is utilized in our day-to-day lives, from how we use toasters to how we know the time on our phones. Everything inside PCs and cell phones has to do with Quantum Physics. When we see an advertisement on television discussing the "Best fiber optic networks" fiber optic networks are acctually Quantum Physics, they utilize light to send electronic directives for you to know when your pizza has arived. Likewise, the promotion you were watching also has to do with Quantum Physics. Quantum Physics is so complicated it puzzled the most brilliant individuals to have existed, even Albert Einstien who at first couldn't help but contradict the theory, he did this because he imagined that everything was reasonable and could be answered some sort of an equation, he beleived that everything was linear and follows a path, however Quantum Physics was thought of as unsolvable and
                  Incomplete.
                  <br>It was December 14th, in the year 1900 when German Physicist Max Planck published his study on the effect of radiation on the "blackbody" substance. "Planck demonstrated that energy, in certain situations, can exhibit characteristics of physical matter." He stated energy is a "continuous wave-like phenomenon" and does not depend on the characteristics of physical matter. His theory stated that "Radiant Energy is made up of particle-like components, known as "quanta." It helps explain phenomena like heat in solids and how light is atomically absorbed.

                  <br> He got a Nobel prize in physics for his work. Other scientists such as Albert Einstein and Erwin Schrodinger "made possible the development of quantum mechanics and mathematical application of the theory that states that energy is both matter and wave depending on certain variables." Max Planck also states "that any energy-radiating atomic system can theoretically be divided into several discrete 'energy elements' " He stated that all of the energy elements were proportional to the frequency v with all of them radiating energy. This is shown in this formula as, ε = hv(ε is pronounced epsilon)(the full equation is, ε stands for "energy(in joules) = Planck's Constant times Frequency") Albert Einstein wanted to explain the photoelectric effect. He said that 'light itself consisted of individual quantum particles" this is now called photons. In 1927 Paul Dirac began unifying quantum mechanics with special relativity by proposing his Dirac equation for the electron. The Dirac equation achieves "relativistic descriptions of the wave function of an electron".

                  <br> To begin going in-depth into how Quantum Mechanics is utilized we must start “basic”, we will figure out how PCs are associated with quantum mechanics. Few supercomputers have ever used quantum physics to turn them "super", even though they are called Quantumn Computers their power can be considered as powerful as that of a super computer. Firstly they are nothing like regular computers hardware-wise they consist of hundreds of wires and metal tubes, In chapter 7 of the book “Quantum Computing Progress and Prospects” pages 113-123 go in-dept onto the hardware of Quantum Computers (https://www.nap.edu/read/25196/chapter/7) . Quantum Computers are cooled to exceptionally low temperatures until they take on their Quantum structures, they additionally utilize metal wires and gold plates making them altogether different from traditional PCs. Traditional PCs work in a series of 1s and 0s known as binary or bits. Even though PCs are mostly dependable because rules can't be bent easily, it isn't useful in specific circumstances. Imagine that you were doing a maze and coded a customary program on a computer to settle it for you, a standard PC would attempt each course until it tracks down the right one. Yet, a Quantum PC would work out all courses immediately and at that point, pick the correct way. This is because they use Qubits rather than normal bits that our computers use, qubits are quite a lot more reliable given the hypothesis that physics works diversely at an atomic and subatomic level. In a 20 qubit framework, there are now 1 million values that can be used for calculations. Alas, it is so difficult to make these sorts of supercomputers because they're extremely delicate and small errors can destroy the entire thing.

                  <br>Another mind-boggling property of quantum physics is the photoelectric effect, The photoelectric effect is when electrons are produced when light hits a particular material. This material would be metal, but there may be other materials that have a similar effect or maybe can conduct the effect even better. This effect is valuable for us in gadgets that are required for light detection and timed electron emission. The outcomes from exploring different routes regarding the photoelectric effect allways seem to contradict the rules of electromagnetism, the photoeletric effect predicts that "persistent light waves move energy to electrons, which would then be radiated when they accumulate sufficient energy." Electromagnetism would likewise differ, in such a case that the power of light was adjusted then the cycle of energy from the electrons with faint light would cause deferred emission(it is bassically stating that if there wasnt enough power from the light then electrons wold be released that well which is not entirely the case with the photoelectric effect).  In any case, all things considered, the photoelectric effects test results show that "electrons are removed just when light surpasses a specific recurrence - paying little mind to the light's force or length of openness."(This shows once light reaches a ceartain frequency the force of the oppeness of the light no longer matters in electron emission) Albert Einstien proposed that light emission isn't a wave yet "a multitude of discrete energy packets, known as photons." For normal metals to produce electrons via conduction there should be some EV light quanta (quanta is the smallest unit of energy) to relate with the short frequency or noticeable bright light. At times, discharges are delivered when photons are moving toward zero energy. The investigation of the photoelectric effect was vital because it drove ventures into understanding the quantum concept of light and electrons while additionally affecting the development of the idea of wave-like molecule duality. Comparative situations where light can influence electric development are the photovoltaic effect and the photoconductive effect. To sum this complicated quality of quantum mechanics up, When beams of photons hit metal it starts to build up electrons and then starts emitting them once the light has reached a ceartain frequency or recurrnace from the light packets known as photons.

                  <br>The photons in a light beam have their particular energy, called photon energy or light quanta. This energy is relative to the recurrence of light. "At the point when an electron inside some material assimilates the energy of a photon and secures more energy than its limiting energy, it is probably going to be shot out." It is expressing that when there is a lot of photon energy in a material it discharges electrons. This peculiarity is special because the energy of discharged electrons relies upon the energy of individual photons, not the frequency. We utilized the photoelectric effect at the beginning of TVs the "picture dissector" used a screen that was involved in the photoelectric effect to change a visual picture into an electrical sign. We utilize the photoelectric impact in such countless ways, now we utilize them in Night vision gadgets and rockets.

                  <br> Although this is just a limited quantity of data about Quantum energy/Mechanics it covers an assortment of things that we utilize in our regular day-to-day existences it gives us an understanding of how complex physics truly is. This was intended to be a synopsis to show you what the universe of Quantumn Physics and Science resembles and how significant it is.
